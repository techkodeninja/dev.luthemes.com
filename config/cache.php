/**
 * Cache configuration for Novaris CMS.
 *
 * This file defines how caching is handled in the Novaris. It includes settings for 
 * purging the cache, setting expiration times, and excluding certain metadata from the 
 * cache to reduce file sizes. Users can also enable full-page caching, define paths to 
 * exclude from global caching, and set up custom cache stores and drivers for advanced 
 * configurations.
 *
 * Key settings:
 * - `purge_key`: Defines the key used for cache purging through specific URLs.
 * - `expires`: Specifies the default cache expiration time (in seconds).
 * - `content_exclude_meta`: Lists metadata that should be excluded from the cache.
 * - `global`: Enables or disables full-page caching.
 * - `global_exclude`: Specifies paths to be excluded from full-page caching.
 *
 * Advanced users can customize cache stores and drivers for tailored caching solutions.
